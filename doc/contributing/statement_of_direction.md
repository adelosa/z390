# Statement of direction

There is a group of z390 and zcobol users interested in continuing the development and support of the z390 Portable Mainframe Assembler and Emulator Project and the zcobol Portable COBOL Compiler as an open source GPL tools for the foreseeable future with free downloads and regular updates.

The z390 and zcobol development and support goals are as follows:

* Enable z390 and zcobol users to compile, assemble, link, and execute mainframe COBOL and assembler problem state programs with minimum source code changes using Windows, Linux, and other platforms supporting a Java runtime.
* Maximize z390 and zcobol user productivity by maintaining and enhancing z390 tools included such as standard GUI interface, common mainframe compatible macros, common supervisor call runtime functions, trace options, debugging facilities such as ZPARTRS source execution trace for assembler and COBOL, and online documentation.
* Maximize z390 and zcobol performance by continually searching for ways to enhance the performance of the assembler and emulator such as the addition of macro pseudo support which yielded a 300% improvement in macro execution speed.
* Maintain single z390 and zcobol open source stream with regression tests which are tested on both Windows and Linux prior to each release.
* Accept, prioritize, code, and test issues and enhancement requests as time permits with z390 and zcobol user contributions and feedback welcome.
